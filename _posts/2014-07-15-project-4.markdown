description: While I do not necessarily think that my first sketch was the most visually appealing piece, I am very proud of the work that I have done regarding it. I am happy with the work that I did with regards to tying images together with motion in order to create a piece that is both engaging and fun to look at. While I don’t believe that it is the most visual appealing yet, I think this can be improved by using more shapes and colors. I used a lot of images which made the work “pop”, but I think if I had added more colors it would have looked less rough. This is an area I want to explore when I make an improved Hello World sketch because I think colors can evoke a lot of emotions. In terms of an audience, I wanted to focus on people who want to an experience a nostalgic rush of emotion. After going to my first Duke game, I was extremely impressed by the enthusiasm and excitement of the alumni. I imagined that they were so engaged in the game because it reminded them of what it was like to attend Duke. I attempted to evoke these feelings of nostalgia through a more “pixelated” piece. I wanted the picture to comment on the excited that a person can feel by not only experiencing something new, but also the excitement someone can feel by participating in something that they have hundreds of times before. I decided to use lots of oranges and blues because the orange reminded me of basketball while the I took the Duke RGB from the official Duke Athletic Blue pallet. I felt that these would be two colors that would mean a lot to my intended audience. I also used images such as basketball hoops, players, and a court to communicate this message to my audience. I also put the sun in the corner of the paper to display childlike imagery and evoke similar emotions. As stated in my README, the experience that has brought me to this work is the fact that before this semester, I had never taken a Visual Arts class, nor had I ever been to a Duke basketball. Since starting the semester, I have been to 3 Duke basketball games and I have attended even more Visual Arts classes than that. I created the work found in this project to display the excitement I have for both basketball and this class.
description2: Hilary Lloyd discussed how she felt energy from inanimate objects, and I think that’s a really important comment. I think that it is much more difficult to relay the way that inanimate things make you feel because there is less action associated with them. I think the viewpoint that Lloyd brings with regard to the sounds, feelings, and sights of very normal, everyday objects is very interesting. I also liked the way that Jeff Koons discusses his thoughts about art. I really related to him when he discussed the aspect of art seeming like it is performance driven but as you look at other artists, you see that this is not necessarily the case. I felt this upon joining the class. I was afraid that my work was going to be extremely subpar but after going through our first critique, I realized that everyone is coming from different places and has different influences, so everyone’s art is unique. Koons approaches his art in a very slow, methodical method and this is shown in his video when he discusses the time it takes to do a painting. Finally, with regards to Wolfgang Laib, I really related to the fact that he likes to do his work alone and without distractions. I think that often times we let outside influences seep into our work and I respect that fact that Laib attempts to really block out distractions. Finally, one of my favorite designers, Virgil Abloh, once said that “The amount of random conversations that lead to culture-shifting ideas is insane.” This impacted me because as stated previously, I think it is the random, unnoticed things that influence us the most. I am hoping that this seeps into my work over the course of the semester.
