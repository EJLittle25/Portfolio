description: This piece was inspired by a post that I saw on Twitter earlier in the week. My original thought was to create a meteor shower that individuals could interact with, but I felt that there was not my desired level of creativity present. Upon scrolling through Twitter, I came across a post of someone who created Lebron James' face out of rubix cubes. I thought this was not only very resourceful and creative, but I really liked how the artworked looked also mosaic. Due to this, I decided to create a piece that utilizes this same mosaic pattern as this Lebron James piece. Not only did I want the piece to be mosaic, but I also wanted the piece to be interactive. I wanted individuals to be able to create their own designs simply by clicking or dragging different tiles. I also incorporated sliders and the ability to clear the grid in order to give individuals a deeper sense of control over their canvas. This allows for both creative patters and childlike designs to be crafted by the user as they please.
