description: The first project that I am examining is called Cell by Keiichi Matsuda and James Alliban, for Alpha Ville Festival. This is an interactive installation that focuses on how our real life is interconnected with our digital life. When a user walks in front of the exhibit, keyword tags mined from online profiles begin to mirror the movement of the user. They begin to surround the body of the individual viewing the exhibit, creating a "profile" for the viewer composed of different words that represent an online persona. According to the website, "Cell uses Microsoftâ€™s Xbox Kinect to track visitors as they interact with the installation. It was built in openFrameworks, an open-source toolkit originally built to teach artists and designers creative coding." This piece was very interesting to me because it really shows the connection between a person's online and physical self. By placing keywords around an individual, it shows that a person's online persona surrounds them at all times. Many people think that when they log off the computer, they are dissociating themselves from their online profile but this exhibit shows that this is not really the case. You are constantly surrounded by your online life and this exhibit demonstrates this. I also thought it was interesting how the words track the movement of the individual using an Xbox Kinect. I thought this was a great combination of art and technology to display a message for individuals.
description2: This is another interactive piece that shows our interconnectivity. Rather than showing how we are connected to our online selves; this shows how we are connected to each other. As stated on the website, " The installation utilized interactive light, spatial sound, and artificial intelligence (AI) to create audiovisual trails of each visitor as they moved through the space." This led to an extremely interesting creation. It shows the shadow of each individual as a trail of light, with each person connected. Slowly, the colors begin to change, and the light begins to spread out. It tracks the individual and how they are moving, and this helps to create trails that will connect the individuals in both the present and past and will help dictate their color in the future. I think this is both visually appealing and mentally stimulating. I think that it is visually appealing due to the wide array of colors and the way that the pixels separate themselves from each other. This looks almost as if they are stars in the sky. I think it is mentally stimulating because it shows that we are all the same on the inside but then we each create our own "colors" because of the unique things we do.
