description: The first piece that I chose that utilizes data is a map of White Supremacist Flyering in the US. This is found on the Souther Poverty Law Center website. I found this piece very interesting because freshman year, I wrote a final paper regarding the growth of the white supremacist movement within the US. This map does an amazing job showing this in my opinion. It not only shows the amount of flyers distributed within each state, but it shows the amount of flyers distributed over time and by group. This is a lot of data that is conveyed and it is presented in a format that is easy to read and navigate. I also like how the columns appear to be popping out of the United States because it adds an interesting layer of depth to the piece. It also helps to easily grasp what flyers are the most prominent in the country.
description2: The second piece that I chose that utilizes data is a rotating globe that shows song popularity in different countries and regions. This is called HikaruUtada (Songs) and is produced by Sony Music Communications Inc. (Japan) monopo. I thought that this piece was very aesthetically pleasing due to the fact that that it is minimalistic. Everything is gray on the globe except for the spires that represent song popularity in different regions. I think that this is powerful and draws your attention to the important things within the piece. I also appreciate that the spires are to scale so that if a column is higher, this means that the song is more popular. I also like that there is a part on the side of the globe that provides numbers regarding streams and placement on the streaming charts. I think that it is important to display this data up front and not rely on the just the columns. The functionality and flexibility of the website is very impressive as well. You can click on countries to pick a reason, you can scroll through a list of regions, or you can choose from a list. This makes the options very transparent and accessible to the average user. The fact that it is easy to use and gain information is important and makes this piece successful.
